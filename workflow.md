Description of the workflow in this project.

## Before starting new work

Check Slack, product backlog and sprint backlog. See what has happened before starting any new work to stay up to date.

## Start a new task

* Check out the task you want to start working on from the sprint backlog and change the status to *in progress*.
* Remember to keep your fork up to date with the original repo! See [this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) for instructions.
* Code the task. MORE DETAIL COMING LATER

### When starting your first task

TLDR: Fork the repository and make pull requests through that.

1. Fork the [RNames repository](https://github.com/karilint/rnames).
2. Clone the repository to your own computer. See [this](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) for more detailed instructions.
3. Configure git to sync the fork with the original repository. More detailed instructions can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork).

## Task is done

When the coding for the task is done, follow these steps.
* Make a pull request. INSTRUCTIONS COMING LATER
* Ask someone to review the PR.
* Go through possible comments or requests for changes and assess them.
  * Do the required changes and ask for someone to check out the changes.
* When PR is approved, it is ready to be merged. DETAILS COMING LATER

## When you are asked to review a pull request

* Go through the changes.
* Write comments to the PR and request changes if needed. Inform the opener of the PR that the PR has been reviewed.
  * When the requested changes have been made, review the PR again and make comments if necessary.
* Mark the PR approved if/when the PR is ready to be merged and inform the opener about the approval.
